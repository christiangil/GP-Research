draw multivariate data from known type of GP

add (circular?) keplerian signal to first component

along a grid in fine frequency space, find likelihoods for best fit orbital parameters at that period with fixed (test with true, then try with different/reasonable) GP hyperparameters

for better likelihoods fit again with orbital params + GP hyperparameters
